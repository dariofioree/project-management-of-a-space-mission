Thetys Space Mission: Technical and Project Management Report
This repository contains the complete technical and project management report for the Thetys Space Mission, a CubeSat project designed to demonstrate the feasibility of electrolysis in space. The mission aims to split water into hydrogen and oxygen under microgravity, contributing to sustainable energy production for future space exploration and aligning with Goal 7 of the UN 2030 Agenda.

The report covers:

- Mission Concept & Objectives: The role of Thetys in space-based hydrogen production.
  
- Technical Design: CubeSat architecture, electrolysis system, energy management, and attitude control.
  
- Project Management: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), risk analysis, cost estimation, scheduling (Gantt chart), and stakeholder responsibilities.
  
- System Integration & Testing: AIT/AIV phases, microgravity simulations, and operational readiness.
